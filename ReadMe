FabonacciAssignment
Assignment for internship SyncVR

Heya! If you read this, I hope to be a part of your team as an intern at SyncVR. I hope you like the small FabonacciClicker I made ^^

I made this project in about... 7 hours? I was stuck a bit in the part of resetting the clicker, but it was actually a really easy answer. So without that problem, it took me around 6 hours to make this ^^

Didn't have more time because of work but oh well, I hope this is good enough to show my skills.
